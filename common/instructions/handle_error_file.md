<Instruction>
    You need to identify the file in the log that is causing the error and output only its name.
    The file name may appear in the log after the line "Database error in the core_customer model (for example)".
    There may be multiple files, so separate them in a comma-separated list (e.g. file1.ext, file2.ext).
